# AI for Network Intrusion Detection System

This project is a collaboration between STMicroelectronics and two students from Polytech Nantes. The goal of this project is to detect network intrusion in smart vehicles using an AI.

## Introduction

This readme explains which classes have been developped for this project and the way they can be used in order to detect intrusions in a network. It basically indicates how to reproduce this system by yourself.

## Data

The dataset used is given by researchers from the University of New Brunswick, in Canada.
